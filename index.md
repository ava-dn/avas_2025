**My Journey**

In the first few days of AP Computer Science Principles, I struggled getting Kasm and VS code 

to work on the school chromebook I was using. I decided to use a windows computer which

I set up smoothly the first time. I created my github account, downloaded Powershell, 

Linux, WSL, as well as VS Code with all the necessary extensions. I checked the 

versions for ruby, python, jupyter, and bundlr and everything was at the appropriate 

version. Later, I cloned my nighthawk repository in order to sync it with vs 

code. I ran into a problem because it got lost in all my files causing me to 

have to look for it. Eventually, I recloned my github repositroy which was successful.

 I've overcome many challenges and have learned so much so far in this class and I'm 

 excited to learn even more.
