MC Personal reflection:

Strengths:

Core Concepts: I did well on questions about basic programming, algorithms,

 and data representation (e.g., Q1, Q5, Q9).

Security & Privacy: I understood topics related to data security,

 such as Q9 (Transmit private data securely) and Q31 (Use of a copyrighted application).



Weaknesses:



Binary & Data Analysis: I struggled with questions on binary data (e.g., Q12, Q17) 

and need more practice in this area.




Error Detection: 


I had difficulty identifying code errors in questions like Q4 (Cause of overflow error)

 and Q15 (Program comparison). Computational Thinking: Questions requiring the application 
 
 of algorithms, like Q47 (Binary search) and Q50 (Reasonable time algorithms), were challenging.




Test-Taking Strategy:




Time Management: I spent too much time on some questions (e.g., Q32, Q54), 

so I need to work on pacing myself during the real exam.


Accuracy Over Speed: Some mistakes were due to rushing. I’ll focus on checking my work for accuracy.



Moving Forward:


I plan to review binary concepts and practice debugging.

I’ll also work on time management by practicing with timed exams.


In summary, while I’m strong in certain areas, I need to focus on binary data, 

debugging, and computational problem-solving to improve my performance.
