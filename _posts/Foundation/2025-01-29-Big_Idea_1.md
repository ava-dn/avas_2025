**1.1 Collaboration**



1.C: Collaboration involves working with others to design and implement code, 

incorporating feedback, and integrating different parts of a program. This promotes teamwork 

and communication, which are critical for large-scale 

software projects.



6.A: Collaboration also entails using version control tools (like Git) and other platforms

 to track changes and manage contributions from multiple 

developers.


**1.2 Program Function and Purpose**


1.A: Involves understanding the function of the program, i.e., what problem the program is 

designed to solve and how it serves a purpose for its 

users.


3.A: This concept focuses on how to express the functionality of a program through clear documentation, 

defining the program's objectives, and 

ensuring it meets user needs.


4.A: Encourages reflection on how the program aligns with its intended purpose and the ways its 

functions contribute to solving the problem.


**1.3 Program Design and Development**


1.B: This involves the process of designing a program, starting with the problem-solving 

approach and identifying the features that need to be 

implemented.


1.C: Emphasizes the importance of iterative design, where the program is developed incrementally,

 and feedback from earlier stages helps refine 

the design.


4.A: Focuses on the practical steps of transforming a design into code, considering factors

 like modularity, efficiency, and scalability.


6.C: Highlights the importance of documentation, code comments, and testing throughout the 

development process to ensure the program is 


functional, understandable, and maintainable.


**1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors**


This section emphasizes debugging, where students learn to identify logical and syntax errors 

in their code and correct them through testing, code 


reviews, and debugging tools. Understanding how to find and fix issues is key to producing reliable

 software. The process may include:


Using debugging tools to step through code.


Writing test cases to verify the behavior of the program.


Iterating over code to ensure the program works correctly in various scenarios.


Summary of Key Concepts


Collaboration: Working with others and using version control.


Program Function and Purpose: Understanding and documenting the programâ€™s goals.


Program Design and Development: Iterative design and translating that into working code.



Identifying and Correcting Errors: Debugging and ensuring program reliability.
