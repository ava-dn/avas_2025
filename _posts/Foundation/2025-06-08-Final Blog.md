### Favorite project and my Unique Qualities


As a developer deeply interested in data, social media trends, and user engagement, one of the projects I’m most proud of is a social media analysis platform built specifically for LEGOLAND. At the heart of it is a custom-built tool I developed called the Hashtag Engagement Analyzer.

This tool allows users to input branded or community hashtags and instantly receive key metrics such as:

Average likes per hashtag, Estimated reach/views, A calculated success score out of 10

My unique qualities: I heavily helped design the frontend of the page and came up with the idea of extracting data from Legoland. I helped in bringing the team closer with one another

At Night at the Museum last week, our table attracted a steady crowd throughout the event. I was excited to see how engaged people were with our project, a Legoland social media website that analyzed various social media metrics. Many visitors found the concept fascinating, and I enjoyed explaining how we tracked and interpreted user engagement, reach, and growth trends. The positive feedback and thoughtful questions from the audience made the experience very rewarding and motivating. Overall, presenting our project in such a dynamic environment was an incredible opportunity to share our work and connect with others interested in computer science and social media analytics.


After we finished presenting, I had the chance to explore some of the other tables and check out a variety of impressive projects. One that caught my attention was the Bathroom Pass project—I got to see firsthand how it functions, which was really clever. I also spent some time at Vibha’s table, where she showcased a collection of mini-games designed to promote health in a fun and interactive way. It was inspiring to see such creativity and innovation from my peers.
