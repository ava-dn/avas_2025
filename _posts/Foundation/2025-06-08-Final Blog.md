**FAVORITE PROJECT** - Project from trimester 3 -->   Legoland social media analyzer


As a developer deeply interested in data, social media trends, and user engagement, one of the projects I’m most proud of is a social media analysis platform built specifically for LEGOLAND. At the heart of it is a custom-built tool I developed called the Hashtag Engagement Analyzer.


This project made me qualified to win a paid Pilot city internship which is why I selected this as my favorite project.




**My Unique Qualities** I played a key role in designing the front-end interface of our project, ensuring it was both visually engaging and user-friendly. Additionally, I proposed the idea of extracting and analyzing data from Legoland’s social media presence, which became a central focus of our project. Beyond the technical aspects, I also contributed to fostering strong collaboration within our team, helping to maintain a positive and cohesive working environment throughout the development process.

At Night at the Museum last week, our table attracted a steady crowd throughout the event. I was excited to see how engaged people were with our project, a Legoland social media website that analyzed various social media metrics. Many visitors found the concept fascinating, and I enjoyed explaining how we tracked and interpreted user engagement, reach, and growth trends. The positive feedback and thoughtful questions from the audience made the experience very rewarding and motivating. Overall, presenting our project in such a dynamic environment was an incredible opportunity to share our work and connect with others interested in computer science and social media analytics.


After we finished presenting, I had the chance to explore some of the other tables and check out a variety of impressive projects. One that caught my attention was the Bathroom Pass project—I got to see firsthand how it functions, which was really clever. I also spent some time at Vibha’s table, where she showcased a collection of mini-games designed to promote health in a fun and interactive way. It was inspiring to see such creativity and innovation from my peers.
