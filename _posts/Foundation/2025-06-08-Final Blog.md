### Favorite project and my Unique Qualities


As a developer deeply interested in data, social media trends, and user engagement, one of the projects Iâ€™m most proud of is a social media analysis platform built specifically for LEGOLAND. At the heart of it is a custom-built tool I developed called the Hashtag Engagement Analyzer.
