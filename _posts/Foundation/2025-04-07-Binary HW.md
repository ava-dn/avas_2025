#### Binary HW



## Popcorn Hack #1 


# Which of the following conditions must be met in order for the procedure to work as intended? Explain why.


a) The length of numList must be even
b) The list numList must not contain any duplicate values
c) The values in numList must be in sorted order
d) The value of target must not be equal to -1


Correct answer is C because binary Search works by splitting the search space in half repeatedly. 

To do that, the algorithm needs to know whether to search the left or right half of the list based on 

the middle value. This only makes sense if the list is sorted.
