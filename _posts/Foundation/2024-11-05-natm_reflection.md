## 🎨 Presentation Overview
At the **Night at the Museum (N@tM)**, our team unveiled a **social media page project** that combined **frontend aesthetics** with **backend functionality**. The goal was to highlight how **user actions**, such as posting content, seamlessly integrated with the backend database. Key features included:

🖌️ **Stylish Design:** A visually engaging interface with cohesive color schemes and clean layout.  
🛠️ **Backend Integration:** Real-time updates storing and retrieving user data via Python.  
⚡ **Live Demo:** Audience members could interact directly, creating posts and exploring the page.
