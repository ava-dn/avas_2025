Task 1: creative commons license


Task 2: I picked a Creative Commons (CC) License so people can use, share, and improve

 my work while giving me credit. This makes it easy for others to learn from and build 
 
 on my project. It also helps keep my work open and useful to more people. At the same 
 
 time, the license prevents misuse and makes sure Iâ€™m still recognized as the original creator.
