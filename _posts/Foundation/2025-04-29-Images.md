### HW HACK


**What is a hex color code?**
A hex color code is a way to show colors using numbers and letters.
**Examples:** #FF0000 (red), #00FF00 (green), #0000FF (blue)
My work: I used hex codes to choose colors for my website buttons.

**What is Base64 and how is it used with images?**
Base64 turns data, like an image, into letters and numbers so it can go in code.
My work: I used Base64 to add an image to my webpage without uploading a file.

**Why might you use Base64 instead of a regular image file?**
You can use it right in the code, no need for a separate file.



<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/iii.jpg" alt="photo">



I added an image by dragging and dropping it into the "images" section, then used this code to display it:


img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/iii.jpg" alt="photo"


### How itâ€™s stored and displayed:
The image is saved as a file (like PNG or JPG) in the "images" folder of the project. The Markdown code tells Jupyter Notebook where the image is and how to show it. When the notebook runs, it loads the image from that folder and displays it right in the notebook.
