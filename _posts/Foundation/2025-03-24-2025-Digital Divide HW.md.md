To fix the digital divide, we can expand access to affordable internet and technology, 

offer digital literacy programs, and ensure underserved communities receive support. 

Some efforts already include government-funded internet access and nonprofit initiatives. 

We can add more public Wi-Fi spaces and increase tech training for all ages to 

bridge the gap further.



## HW Hack




- added a loop to iterate through each row of the cleaned dataset, checking the value of 

Rate (WB) (internet access percentage).


- Depending on whether the percentage is above or below 70%, the program prints the country 

name, the percentage, and either "doing great" or "needs improvement."


- The solution uses a simple conditional statement within a loop to generate the 

desired output for each country.




import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("internet_users.csv").drop(columns=['Notes', 'Year.2', 'Users (CIA)', 'Rate (ITU)', 'Year.1']) # Drop extra columns: we will not be using these

data_cleaned = data.dropna() # Drop rows with NaN (aka blank) values

print(data_cleaned.head()) # Display the first few rows of the cleaned data

# print(len(data)) # Check num of rows before removing blank rows
# print(len(data_cleaned)) # Check num of rows after removing blank rows

Location  Rate (WB)    Year
0        World       67.4  2023.0
1  Afghanistan       18.4  2020.0
2      Albania       83.1  2023.0
3      Algeria       71.2  2022.0
5      Andorra       94.5  2022.0

y = data_cleaned['Rate (WB)'] # Take Percentage of the population using the internet from World Bank data in dataset
name = data_cleaned['Location'] # take country name from WB data in dataset

# [INSERT YOUR CODE HERE]
data_cleaned['Status'] = ['doing great' if rate > 70 else 'needs improvement' for rate in y]

# Print the results
for country, rate, status in zip(name, y, data_cleaned['Status']):
    print(f"{country}: {rate}%: {status}")
