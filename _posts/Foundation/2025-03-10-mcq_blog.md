## MC Personal reflection:



## Strengths:

Core Concepts: I did well on questions about basic programming, algorithms,

 and data representation (e.g., Q1, Q5, Q9).

Security & Privacy: I understood topics related to data security,

 such as Q9 (Transmit private data securely) and Q31 (Use of a copyrighted application).



## Weaknesses:



Binary & Data Analysis: I struggled with questions on binary data (e.g., Q12, Q17) 

and need more practice in this area.




## Error Detection: 


I had difficulty identifying code errors in questions like Q4 (Cause of overflow error)

 and Q15 (Program comparison). Computational Thinking: Questions requiring the application 
 
 of algorithms, like Q47 (Binary search) and Q50 (Reasonable time algorithms), were challenging.




## Test-Taking Strategy:




Time Management: I spent too much time on some questions (e.g., Q32, Q54), 

so I need to work on pacing myself during the real exam.


Accuracy Over Speed: Some mistakes were due to rushing. I’ll focus on checking my work for accuracy.



## Moving Forward:


I plan to review binary concepts and practice debugging.

I’ll also work on time management by practicing with timed exams.


In summary, while I’m strong in certain areas, I need to focus on binary data, 

debugging, and computational problem-solving to improve my performance.





## CPT Requirements

### Adding Location and Review to History:

```python
self.location_history.append({"user_id": user_id, "location": location, "review": review})
```

This code adds a user’s location and their review to the `location_history` list. It helps track the locations users have pinned along with their associated reviews, creating a historical log for future reference.

---

### Student-Developed Procedure:

```python
def save_location(self, user_id, latitude, longitude, review):
    """Save a specific location with its review.""" 
    location = {"user_id": user_id, "latitude": latitude, "longitude": longitude, "review": review} 
    self.location_history.append(location) 
    return location
```

The `save_location` method stores a user's latitude, longitude, and review for a particular location. This allows users to return to the same spot later by saving and referencing their data in the system.

---

### Algorithm (Sequencing, Selection, Iteration):

```python
try:
    location_data = request.get_json()

    if not location_data or 'latitude' not in location_data or 'longitude' not in location_data:
        return jsonify({"error": "Latitude and Longitude are required"}), 400
```

This code illustrates selection through the `if` statement. It checks whether the required fields (latitude and longitude) are present in the incoming request data. If missing, it returns an error message indicating that both coordinates are necessary.

---

### Procedure Call:

```python
location_response = self.save_location(user_id, latitude, longitude, review)
```

This line calls the `save_location` method to store the user's location and their review. It sends the received data to be saved and stores it in the system, preparing a response for the user.

---

### Output Statement:

```python
return jsonify({"message": "Location saved successfully", "location": location_response})
```

This statement sends a JSON response back to the user, confirming that their location and review have been saved successfully. It includes the saved location data to verify that the operation was successful.

---

### CRUD Functionality in Model:

```python
def create(self):
    """Save the location to the database.""" 
    db.session.add(self) 
    db.session.commit()
```

This `create` method adds the location object to the database session and commits it, effectively saving the new location record to the database. This supports the "Create" aspect of CRUD functionality.
