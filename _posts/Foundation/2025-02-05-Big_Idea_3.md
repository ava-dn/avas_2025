**Big Idea 3**


<button><a href="https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=3">AP CLASSROOM</a></button>





**Variables and Assignments (3.1)**

3.A: Introduces variables as abstractions used to represent and store data. 

Variables allow us to store various data types, such as numbers, Booleans, lists,

and strings. These variables act as containers for data that can be used throughout a program.



3.B: Covers how to change the value stored in a variable using the assignment operator (=). 

The assignment operator allows us to update a variable with a new value during program execution, 

which is crucial for dynamic programs.



**AP Daily Videos:**



3.1: Daily Video 1: Explains the concept of variables as abstractions for representing 

and storing data types like numbers, Booleans, strings, and lists.



3.1: Daily Video 2: Demonstrates how to use the assignment operator to change the 

value stored in a variable.



**Data Abstraction (3.2)**


3.A: Data abstraction is about simplifying complex systems by focusing on the essential 

properties and hiding unnecessary details. Variables serve as an abstraction layer to represent 

data in programming.



3.B: The abstraction of data allows for easier understanding and manipulation in programs, making 

code more manageable.



3.C: Encourages leveraging abstractions like variables to simplify complex problems and 

their solutions.




**Mathematical Expressions (3.3)**



2.A: Discusses the evaluation of mathematical expressions in programming. These expressions can 

involve operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex 

mathematical functions.



2.B: Expands on the application of mathematical expressions in real-world coding scenarios, 

focusing on how operators and expressions are applied to manipulate and calculate data.


**Strings (3.4)**


4.B: Involves working with strings, which are sequences of characters. String 

manipulation includes 

operations like concatenation, slicing, and formatting.




**Boolean Expressions (3.5)**



2.B: Focuses on Boolean logic, including logical operators such as AND, OR, 

and NOT, and their 

application in conditional statements.



4.B: Elaborates on how Boolean expressions are used in programming to control flow based on

logical conditions.




**Conditionals (3.6)**



2.A: Introduces conditional statements (e.g., if, else) for decision-making in programs based on 

conditions or expressions evaluating to True or False.



2.B: Expands on conditional logic and how multiple conditions can be combined using Boolean 

operators.



4.B: Discusses the use of conditionals in algorithms to alter the flow of execution depending 

on different conditions.



**Nested Conditionals (3.7)**



2.B: Explains nested conditionals, where one conditional statement is inside another. 

This structure allows for more complex decision-making logic in programs.



4.B: Further explores nested conditionals and their impact on program behavior.



**Iteration (3.8)**



2.A: Introduces iteration (loops), including for and while loops, as a way to 

repeatedly execute code until a condition is met.



2.B: Expands on using iteration to handle repeated tasks efficiently in programs, 

including nested loops.



**Developing Algorithms (3.9)**



1.D: Explains the process of developing algorithms to solve problems systematically 

using step-by-step logic.



2.A: Introduces the concepts behind algorithm design and how to express solutions in the 

form of algorithms.



2.B: Discusses the importance of refining and optimizing algorithms for efficiency and clarity.



**Lists (3.10)**



2.B: Discusses lists as a data structure used to store multiple items, and how to perform operations 

like indexing, slicing, and updating elements.



4.B: Focuses on how to manipulate lists in more complex ways, including advanced

 operations and nested lists.





üåü Sprint 1: A New Beginning with Frontend & SASS

üìù Summary:


In Sprint 1, I took my first step into the world of coding through frontend development.

I learned to use SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)‚Äîa tool that made styling websites 

feel creative and empowering. Before this class, I 
 
had no idea what SASS even was, but now I‚Äôm customizing web pages like a pro!

üìö Key Learnings:

Making CSS Fun with SASS:


SASS helped me organize my code better, with tools like variables (for reusable colors),

mixins (for repeatable styles), and nested rules (so much cleaner!).


Designing Like a Pro:

I practiced creating visually consistent layouts with great color schemes and typography. 


üîç Improvements:

Simplifying Code:

I learned to reduce repetition by using SASS mixins, making my stylesheets not just 

functional but also easy to manage.


üí™ Challenges:

What‚Äôs a Mixin?!:

At first, the new SASS syntax was a head-scratcher. But through practice and 

building real projects, I gained confidence and started having fun with it.
