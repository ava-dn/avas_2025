## 🌟 Sprint 1: A New Beginning with Frontend & SASS  

**📝 Summary:**  
In **Sprint 1**, I took my first step into the world of coding through **frontend development**. I learned to use **SASS** (*Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets*)—a tool that made styling websites feel creative and empowering. Before this class, I had no idea what **SASS** even was, but now I’m customizing web pages like a pro!  

**📚 Key Learnings:**
- **Making CSS Fun with SASS:**  
   SASS helped me organize my code better, with tools like **variables** (for reusable colors), **mixins** (for repeatable styles), and **nested rules** (so much cleaner!).  
- **Designing Like a Pro:**  
   I practiced creating **visually consistent layouts** with great **color schemes** and **typography**. It felt like building art through code!

**🔍 Improvements:**
- **Simplifying Code:**  
   I learned to reduce repetition by using **SASS mixins**, making my stylesheets not just functional but also easy to manage.  

**💪 Challenges:**  
- **What’s a Mixin?!:**  
   At first, the new SASS syntax was a head-scratcher. But through practice and building real projects, I gained confidence and started having fun with it.

## 🖥️ Sprint 2: Teaching Programming Concepts  

**📝 Summary:**  
Sprint 2 introduced me to **Big Idea 3**, where I explored programming fundamentals like **variables**, **loops**, and **conditionals** in **Python** and **JavaScript**. I even created and presented a **Tech Talk** and led **interactive coding activities** with my classmates.  

**📚 Key Learnings:**
- **Programming is Universal:**  
   Seeing how concepts like loops and conditionals work across Python and JavaScript opened my eyes to the logic that powers all programming languages.  
- **Engaging an Audience:**  
   Creating a lesson plan and explaining programming concepts taught me to simplify complex ideas and make them accessible to everyone.

**🔍 Improvements:**
- **Building Confidence:**  
   Leading activities like **popcorn hacks** helped me become more comfortable talking about code and interacting with others.  
- **Better Communication Skills:**  
   I learned how to break down technical concepts into bite-sized explanations that everyone could follow.

**💪 Challenges:**  
- **Finding the Right Balance:**  
   It was tough to deliver enough content in under five minutes for my Tech Talk while keeping it engaging. Multiple revisions helped me find the perfect flow.

## 📱 Sprint 3: Building a Social Media Page  

**📝 Summary:**  
Sprint 3 was the most exciting yet—it felt like magic! I worked on building a **social media page** with **frontend and backend integration**. This was my first time connecting a web page to a **database**, and it amazed me to see how user data could be stored and retrieved in real time.  

**📚 Key Learnings:**
- **Full-Stack Development:**  
   I got hands-on experience with how the **frontend** (what users see) and **backend** (where the data lives) work together to create a functional website.  
- **Database Management:**  
   Learning CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage user data was like unlocking a hidden door to the backend world.

**🔍 Improvements:**
- **Debugging Pro:**  
   Debugging connectivity issues between the frontend and backend made me a more patient problem solver.  
- **Confidence with Databases:**  
   By the end of this sprint, I could structure, store, and retrieve data confidently. This felt like a huge win!

**💪 Challenges:**  
- **The Puzzle of Integration:**  
   Connecting the frontend and backend wasn’t easy. Every error felt like a new puzzle, but solving them gave me an incredible sense of accomplishment.

## 🏆 Overall Reflection:  
Starting this class, I knew *nothing* about coding. Now, after these three sprints, I can confidently say that coding has opened my eyes to a world of creativity and problem-solving. From designing web pages with **SASS** to teaching programming concepts and building a dynamic **social media app**, I’ve learned so much more than I thought possible in such a short time.  

These sprints taught me not just technical skills but also **confidence, communication, and perseverance**. I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me next!
