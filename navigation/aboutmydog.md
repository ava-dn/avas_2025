**All About Coco**

My dog's name is Coco. Coco is about 1 and a half years old. She is a french bulldog. Some of her 

favorite foods are hamburgers, salmon, as well as peanut butter. Coco's favorite activities are 

sleeping and playing with other dogs. She gets very angry when people are eating and she can't 

have their food. Coco also loves to play tug of war and she especially loves when we chase her 

around the house!
