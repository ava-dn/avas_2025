**All About Coco**

My dog's name is Coco. Coco is about 1 and a half years old. 

 She is a french bulldog. Some of her favorite foods 

are hamburgers and peanut butter. Coco's favorite activities are sleeping 

and playing with other dogs. She gets very angry when people are eating 

food that she can't have.
