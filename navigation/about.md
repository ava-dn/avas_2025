Hi, I'm Ava. I was born in San Diego and I go to Del Norte High School. I'm taking computer science 

principles. I do competitive swim as my sport. I love going to the beach, shopping, and watching tv. 

I love neon colors. Some of my favorite foods are fries, tacos, and mint chocolate chip ice cream. My 

favorite dog breed is a french bulldog. I have an adorable French Bulldog named Coco!
