**All About Me**

Hi I'm Ava and I'm taking Computer Science Principles. My sport is competitive swim.                                                                               🏊‍♀️

I love going to the beach, swimming, and watching T.V. I love neon colors!                                                                                         🌈

My favorite foods are pizza, french fries, and mint chocolate chip ice cream.                                                                                      🍕

My favorite dog breed is a french bulldog. I have a girl dog named Coco who is super cute!                                                                         🐶
