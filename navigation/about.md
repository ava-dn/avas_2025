**All About Me**

Hi I'm Ava and I'm taking Computer Science Principles. My sport is competitive swim. I love going to the beach, swimming, and watching T.V. I love neon colors! My 

favorite foods are pizza, french fries, and mint chocolate chip ice cream. My favorite dog breed is a french bulldog. I have a girl dog named Coco who is super cute!
